# AirScribe Beta
Welcome to the AirScribe beta release repository. This repo will be used to share beta releases of the AirScribe live subtitling and translation app. You can find the latest beta release for the application on the releases page.

AirScribe is designed to be used with the NReal Air AR glasses by providing a heads up display to caption conversations, but can also be used as a traditional app.
